### **Restaurant Website - PHP, HTML, and CSS**  

This project involves the development of a restaurant website, where I focused on both the **front-end** and **back-end** aspects using **PHP**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. The goal was to create a dynamic and interactive website while integrating server-side functionality for enhanced user experience.  

#### **Key Features**  
- Developed the **back-end** using **PHP** to handle requests, data processing, and dynamic content delivery.  
- Designed the **front-end** using **HTML** and **CSS** to create an appealing and responsive layout for users.  
- Integrated basic functionality for viewing menu items, making reservations, and contacting the restaurant.  

#### **Objective**  
To build a fully functional website with both back-end and front-end development skills, while learning how to integrate the two effectively using **PHP**.

This project helped me gain a deeper understanding of how dynamic websites are built, from server-side logic to user-facing design.
